<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Fettuccine Alfredo is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese.</p>
<p>As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta. The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>10 ounces fettuccini pasta</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>


</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet melt the butter and add the chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often, making sure not to burn the garlic.</li>
    <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of the heavy cream into a small bowl. Add the egg yolk and beat together; put aside. Pour the remaining cream into the frying pan. Increase the heat to medium-high. As the cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Slowly add the cream/egg mixture. You do not want the egg to curdle. Continue whisking until well blended.</li>
<li>Add 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the cream. Pour in the remaining Parmesan, mix until smooth. Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta.</li>
